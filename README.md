# issue-board
A single-page application that gives access to github issues and allows you to read and edit issues and comments. It is far from complete, but it showcases a React application which uses React-router, Redux and Thunk to talk to the Github Rest API. It also features Mocha and Chai for unit-testing and some js and sass linting.
